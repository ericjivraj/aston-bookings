# Aston Bookings
 This coursework was developed during my final year of university, it is a Java-based MVC web application that handles bookings. The coursework specifications were prone to us following the "old school" way of building a MVC web application. Please note that the excessive amount of comments was a requirement from the coursework specifications. This coursework was developed in NetBeans as requested by the lecturer.
 
 ## Future Improvements
 - Use Spring MVC framework;
 - Add a service layer;
 - Abstract some of the controller logic in to service layer;
